1. Summary
Student YouTuber and streamer mainly playing League of Legends champions Talon, Yone, and Diana.
He is a self-proclaimed Talon Artisan user who lives in the Silver section.
The physical part is as good as silver, but there are parts that are a little lacking in the physical part.
He mainly uses the Conqueror Talon, and occasionally uses the Electrocute Talon.
He started the game about a month before the end of season 10 and got silver as soon as I started ranking.

2. Play Style
He rolls snowballs well in the early stages and often bursts the game, but in the second half he loses his strength and shows a lot of fainting. Even so, it is sufficiently recoverable and shows high carry power.
At the beginning of the game, he made a lot of solo kills at lvl 2-3 and joined a lot in jungle fights and bottom top fights, showing a lot of mid-difference. Even so, team luck is the worst and shows that he doesn't swear at any moment.
